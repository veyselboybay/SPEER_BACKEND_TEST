Task Description
-Codes are pushed to the GitHub repo.
-To store the datas, MongoDB is used.
-To test sections of the code, I've used Postman.
-Nodemon is already installed, you run the application right away.

-I couldnt complete the section 3 which is bonus part. Just wanted to let you know.

Lastly, thank you for giving me this opportunity to test and show my coding skills.
I hope you like my code and we can discuss it at next step. However, if things dont go in my favor,
it's been a good experience for me. 

Have a good day!
